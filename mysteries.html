      <h2>Mysteries of the Deep Sea</h2>
      <p>
        The deep ocean is one of the most mysterious and least explored places on Earth. With crushing pressures, complete darkness, and strange life forms, it holds secrets that scientists are only beginning to uncover. This page highlights some of the most fascinating mysteries lurking beneath the waves.

      <h3>Mystery #1: The Bloop</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="description-box">
        <p>
          In 1997, researchers recorded a powerful underwater sound in the Pacific Ocean that came to be known as “The Bloop.” It was louder than any known animal and had a unique frequency pattern. While some speculated it might be a massive sea creature, NOAA later suggested it was likely caused by icequakes. Still, the mystery of its origin continues to spark curiosity and debate.

      <h3>Mystery #2: Bioluminescent Creatures</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="description-box">
        <p>
          In the pitch-black depths of the ocean, many creatures produce their own light through bioluminescence. Some use it to lure prey, others to communicate or camouflage. The chemical processes behind this glow are still being studied, and new glowing species are discovered regularly. These radiant organisms challenge our understanding of survival in extreme environments.

      <h3>Mystery #3: Deep-Sea Gigantism</h3>
      <div class="media-box">
        <img src="mystery3.png" alt="Giant deep-sea creature example">
      </div>
      <div class="description-box">
        <p>
          Some deep-sea species grow to enormous sizes compared to their shallow-water relatives — a phenomenon known as deep-sea gigantism. Giant squids, amphipods, and jellyfish are just a few examples. Scientists believe factors like cold temperatures, high pressure, and scarce food may contribute to this growth, but the exact reasons remain unclear. These giants add to the ocean’s sense of mystery and awe.

      <h3>Mystery #4: Hydrothermal Vents</h3>
      <div class="media-box">
        <img src="mystery4.jpg" alt="Hydrothermal vent releasing mineral-rich water">
      </div>
      <div class="description-box">
        <p>
          Hydrothermal vents are openings in the seafloor where superheated, mineral-rich water gushes out. These extreme environments host unique ecosystems, including tube worms and bacteria that thrive without sunlight. The way life survives here raises questions about the origins of life on Earth and even the possibility of life on other planets.

      <h3>Mystery #5: The Mariana Trench</h3>

        <img src="mystery5.jpg" alt="Illustration of the Mariana Trench depths">
      </div>
      <div class="description-box">
        <p>
          The Mariana Trench is the deepest part of the ocean, plunging nearly 36,000 feet. Despite its depth, scientists have discovered organisms adapted to survive under immense pressure. Yet much of this trench remains unexplored, leaving us to wonder what other secrets lie hidden in its darkness.
